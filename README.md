# Greg Conan `.bashrc` File and Tools

I created this repository to store the many convenience tools I have saved and used as a software developer.

## Contents 

### `.bashrc`

This contains the many Bash/Shell shortcut and convenience functions I use while writing Bash/Shell scrips and/or working with Unix/Linux systems using the command-line terminal.

It has evolved significantly to address many needs and uses during my time developing software for Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), the University of Minnesota (UMN), Cisco, DataAnnotation.Tech, and various personal projects like ["Knower."](https://github.com/GregConan/Knower)

### `scrapeRedditLinks.js`

I save a lot of content on Reddit, and am occasionally bothered by my inability to easily access it. So, I am writing a JavaScript tool to scrape the content I've saved from Reddit and convert it into Markdown format to easily reference later.
